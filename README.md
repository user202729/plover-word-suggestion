# plover-word-suggestion
Suggest words for strokes not in the dictionary.

Currently use the ruleset of [Spectra Lexer](https://github.com/fourshade/spectra_lexer/issues) to match the strokes to the spelling.

### Usage

Enable the extension in Plover menu (Configure -> Plugins).

Output data is printed on stdout.

Might depend on package `plover-textarea`, which is currently only compatible with some environments.
